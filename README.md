Project Partial Repository

Overview This repository is intended to share the code with Nehemia for evaluation purposes. It includes various components of our development sprint, featuring backend and frontend integrations.

Contributors Roque: Responsible for creating the views, URLs, and models within the project. Roque also integrated frontend code developed by team members to ensure seamless functionality and user experience. Aina and Satinder: Contributed to the frontend development, crafting the HTML and CSS that define the user interface and styling of the project. Cynthia: Was responsible for creating all the documentation and testing the website functions.

Repository Structure Views: Contains backend logic for handling requests and returning responses. Roque implemented and optimized these for efficient data handling and application flow. URLs: Defined by Roque, these URL patterns are designed to route the application's endpoints effectively, ensuring a robust navigation framework. Models: These are the data structures designed to encapsulate the application's data logic, also implemented by Roque to reflect the project's data requirements accurately. Templates: This folder contains all the HTML files used in the project, reflecting the collaborative effort in frontend development. These templates render the data processed on the backend into a structured and styled format that users interact with.
